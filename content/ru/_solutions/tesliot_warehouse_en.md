[TESLA SMART UZ](https://www.tesliot.com/en) is the Uzbek branch of the Russian company TESLA SMART, specializing in the development and production of wireless TESLiOT equipment for climate monitoring and access control systems. Their solutions are used in both mobile facilities — such as refrigerated trucks and containers within Fleet Management Systems (FMS) — and stationary facilities like food production sites, warehouses requiring specific temperature and humidity conditions, supermarkets, restaurants, server rooms, and data centers in IoT systems.

The company's product range includes advanced Bluetooth 5.2-based solutions, such as base stations and sensors that offer high data exchange rates, extended communication range, energy efficiency, and reliability. Integrators deploy the company's products in industrial automation, logistics, and other fields that require precise monitoring of storage conditions and data processing.

Dmitry first heard about Wiren Board in 2017 from integrators in the FMS market — he has been involved in its development since 2008 — who were collecting data from diesel generators and mini power plants via Modbus and CAN protocols for control purposes.

## Challenges

The 2,200 m² regional warehouse in Bukhara of **Balton Trading Asia (BTA)** — the largest food and perfume distributor in Uzbekistan and the country's first national distributor of FMCG products (including Nestlé, Colgate-Palmolive, Rusagro, Makfa, Oleina, Bunge, and other well-known brands) — features various climate zones. This includes a freezing zone for ice cream stored in a refrigerated container. Prior to implementing the new system, the customer monitored temperature using loggers — devices that automatically record temperature at preset intervals — and manually transferred the data to paper logs three times a day. This process was time-consuming and prone to human error. Additionally, there was no monitoring during off-hours and weekends.

TESLA SMART UZ was tasked with promptly implementing a temperature and humidity monitoring system that would ensure stable operation across the warehouse's different climatic zones.

}

## Solution

The warehouse was equipped with the [**TESLiOT Long Range Edition**](https://www.tesliot.com/en/category/all-products) (Bluetooth Long Range/BLR) temperature and humidity control system. The project was completed in a single working day by a team consisting of one representative from the contractor and one from the customer, despite the facility's complex structure, which includes two dry rooms and an outdoor refrigerated container with an ice cream freezer. 

Three [**TESLiOT-HOST-X BLR**](https://www.tesliot.com/en/category/blr-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80-tesliot-x) **bases** (Bluetooth 5.2 to RS-485 Modbus RTU) were installed in the warehouse, connecting nine [**TESLiOT-TWO-X BLR**](https://www.tesliot.com/en/category/%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BA%D0%B0-two-x) **temperature and humidity sensors**. The sensors were mounted on walls in key areas where local loggers had previously been installed, including the freezer, to ensure accurate, minute-by-minute monitoring. Equipped with frost-resistant lithium-thionyl chloride (Li-SOCl₂) batteries, the sensors can operate autonomously for 1 to 1.5 years. 

A [**Wiren Board controller**](https://wirenboard.com/en/catalog/kontrollery/) was chosen to manage the system. The three HOST-X units were connected in series via RS-485 (Modbus RTU) to the controller, which was connected to the wired internet through its Ethernet port. All power components and bases were placed in protective enclosures to enhance system reliability. The controller automatically transmits data to the **Rightech IoT Cloud (RIC)** platform, eliminating manual data entry and reducing human error. The platform also simplifies climate control and provides user-friendly data visualization through dashboards, widgets, reports in a web interface, and a mobile application for Android and iOS.

*Fast Implementation*: The system was installed and operational in just one working day.

*Automation*: Manual entry of temperature logs was completely eliminated, increasing accuracy and ease of monitoring.

*Remote Monitoring*: The central office gained the ability to remotely monitor climate conditions in the regional warehouse.

*Reliability and Durability*: Protected components and autonomous sensors ensure stable operation even in challenging freezer environments.

The system streamlined the monitoring of storage conditions, guaranteeing product safety—an essential factor for the distributor. After seven months of successful operation, the customer decided to equip approximately ten more BTA warehouses across all regional centers of Uzbekistan with the TESLiOT Long Range Edition system.

The next project for TESLA SMART UZ is to equip one of BTA's central Class "A" warehouses in Tashkent, covering an area of 7,800 m², to meet the needs of **Yandex.Food**.
