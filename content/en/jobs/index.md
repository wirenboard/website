Wiren Board develops and manufactures electronics for the automation of engineering systems: industrial and commercial facilities, private homes and apartments. Customers include both professional integrators and smart home enthusiasts.

Wiren Board was founded in 2013 by three graduates of Fiztech. The owners of the company are people who know how to do tough engineering things themselves, and there is a lot to learn from them. The company has a Western style of management. There is no strict hierarchy, the distance between top management and staff is minimal, and communication is exclusively on a first-name basis. Any employee can propose an idea at a general meeting. Employees are involved in the decision-making process.

[The main office is in Dolgoprudny](https://yandex.ru/maps/-/CDCQV0yi), but many employees work remotely. We plan to scale production, open offices in Europe and Asia, take over the world =)

There are more than 20 people in our engineering team. The work can be roughly divided into three big directions:
* device circuitry;
* software development and support for Linux;
* software development and support for microcontrollers.
