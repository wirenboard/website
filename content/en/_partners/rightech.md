Rightech IoT Cloud (RIC) platform is a cloud platform for developers and integrators of IoT solutions. The RIC platform is an intermediate link between devices (sensors, actuators, etc.) on the one hand and applications on the other. Using platform tools, developers create IoT solutions without unnecessary code. And then they reuse 90% of these solutions and launch similar cases. RIC is independent of specific hardware and protocols. Therefore, it allows you to combine different devices under one solution.


The platform communicates with devices via protocols and with external services via API. This allows application developers and system integrators to create their own IoT applications on top of the platform for their clients.
The platform allows you to integrate with any external services, ERP, CRM systems, payment services and third-party applications.
You can connect any number of different devices or projects around the world to the RIC and quickly scale your business.
