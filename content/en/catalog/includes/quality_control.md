We develop and manufacture all Wiren Board devices ourselves. Also everyone devices undergo multi-stage quality control:
- During development - checking the components used for compliance with the declared ones characteristics and testing of the prototype device at extreme operating conditions.
- After installation of SMD components - automated optical control.
- After soldering the lead components - visual inspection of soldering.
- After assembling the device, functional testing on an automated stand.
- When shipped to the warehouse - control of completeness, stickers, appearance.

Thanks to this approach, the failure rate is no more than 0.5% of all released devices.

If the device fails within two years from the date of purchase, [we will replace it for free](https://wirenboard.com/en/pages/warranty/) without need to be sent to a service center.
