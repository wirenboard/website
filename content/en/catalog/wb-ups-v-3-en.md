Four independent battery overvoltage protection levels:

1. The microcontroller gradually stops charging when the battery voltage reaches 8.1 V;
2. Hardware protection A prevents charging above 8.2 V;
3. Protection B stops charging if the voltage of any cell exceeds 4.25 V;
4. Protection C blows a “sacrificial” fuse if the voltage of any cell exceeds 4.3 V.
Three independent overcurrent protection levels:

- Charge and discharge currents are limited;
- The battery is disconnected if the current exceeds 4 A;
- The fuse blows in case of a short-circuit current.
The battery is protected against overheating both by hardware and software mechanisms.

}
Battery temperature is monitored during both charging and discharging to prevent accelerated wear and dendrite formation.

Charging the battery to 8.1 V instead of the standard 8.4 V significantly increases its lifespan with only a minor reduction in usable capacity.

Full discharge is prevented — the load is disconnected when battery voltage drops to 6 V.

A balancing circuit equalizes the voltage across the cells, ensuring uniform charge levels.

}
If the power or capacity of a single WB-UPS v.3 is insufficient, multiple units can be connected in parallel, with this mode enabled in the settings. The devices will automatically share the load between them.

Engaging the hidden button cuts off the battery to avoid discharge. The battery is re-enabled automatically once external power is available. This prevents UPS battery depletion during delivery.

}
The device status information available via Modbus RTU includes:

- Operating mode;
- Battery charge level;
- Input and output voltages;
- Battery temperature;
- Battery current;
- Input current;
- Input current used for battery charging;
- Output current when running on battery;
- Front panel button status and counters for button presses (short, long, double short, short + long).
Moreover, device parameters can be configured via Modbus RTU:

- Operating mode;
- Output voltage;
- Maximum battery charge and discharge currents.
It also enables turning the load on or off when external power is absent.

}
The device can be configured via the Wiren Board controller’s web interface.

When used with other equipment, configuration is performed by writing setup parameters to the corresponding Modbus registers.

The device card in the Wiren Board controller’s web interface displays all channels enabled in the settings.

}
All Wiren Board devices, in addition to standard Modbus RTU, can operate with its extension [Fast Modbus](https://wiki.wirenboard.com/wiki/Fast_Modbus/en) ⚡, which adds new capabilities:

- instant polling of input states and measured values via events;
- quick discovery of devices connected to the controller;
- automatic resolution of address conflicts on the bus.
These features are enabled automatically — if the device supports Fast Modbus, the controller will use it. Otherwise, it falls back to standard Modbus RTU.
